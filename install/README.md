### AUTOMATED INSTALLER

Grant privileges and run installer script:

This script will check for Homebrew (and try and install it, if not present), attempt a Homebrew 
install of the latest PIrANHA update (cutting-edge development version, including commits after 
last stable release). If a Homebrew install is not possible, then the script will run a routine 
for local `git` install and setup.

```bash
cd piranha-master/ ;
cd install/ ;
chmod u+x ./* ;
local_piranha ;
#
cp local_piranha ~/bin/ ; # makes installer available from command line, for future use (assuming ~/bin/ is in $PATH, as usual)
```

For more information on options for installing 'by-hand', please see the [Quick Guide for the Impatient](https://github.com/justincbagley/piranha/wiki#quick-guide-for-the-impatient) 
in the PIrANHA GitHub [Wiki pages](https://github.com/justincbagley/piranha/wiki).
