# BEASTPostProc

THIS SCRIPT aids post-processing of BEAST output files resulting from runs using the standard BEAST divergence time approach (Drummond et al. 2006), or the multispecies coalescent as implemented in the \*BEAST model (Heled & Drummond 2010). Specifically, this code 1) summarizes the length and posterior distributions of parameters in the run using LogAnalyser, and then 2) obtains 5000 random post-burnin trees and uses them to infer a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree annotated with posterior probabilities and node divergence time estimates in TreeAnnotator. The code is written in a way to automate these common procedures by taking advantage of available utilities for post-processing that come with the BEAST (v1.8.3) distribution. 

BEAST v1.8.3++ must be installed locally for this code to work. In addition, it is assumed that you know the absolute path to these programs, or that you have already placed the bin folder holding "loganalyser" and "treeannotator" executables in your path, so that they are available from the command line. Prior to running the current version of this script, the user must open the script and replace absolute paths to the above programs with the absolute paths on their machine.

If you have run BEAST, this code processes the posterior distributions of gene trees only. However, if you are processing results of a \*BEAST run, this code processes the gene tree and species tree results in the run directory. Files are stored in folders that currently have long names; this is on my list of needed bug fixes.

For interpreting files output by this script, please refer to the BEAST websites (http://beast.community and http://beast2.org), published papers on the software (e.g. Drummond et al., 2012), manuals and other docs included in the BEAST distributions, and also tutorials and comments on using BEAST on my website (http://www.justinbagley.org).
