## INTRODUCTION

*Taking steps towards automating boring stuff during analyses of genetic data in phylogenomics & phylogeography...*

**```PIrANHA```** v0.1.7 is a repository of shell scripts and R scripts written by the author, as well as additional code (R, Perl, and Python scripts) from other authors, that is designed to help automate processing and analysis of DNA sequence data in phylogenetics and phylogeography research projects (Avise 2000; Felsensetin 2004). PIrANHA is fully command line-based and, rather than being structured as a single pipeline, it contains a series of scripts, some of which form pipelines, for aiding or completing tasks during evolutionary analyses of genetic data. Currently, PIrANHA scripts facilitate running or linking the following software programs:

- **```pyRAD```** (Eaton 2014) or **```ipyrad```** (Eaton and Overcast 2016)
- **```PartitionFinder```** (Lanfear et al. 2012, 2016)
- **```BEAST```** (Drummond et al. 2012; Bouckaert et al. 2014)
- **```starBEAST```** (Heled & Drummond 2010)
- **```SNAPP```** (Bryant et al. 2012)
- **```MrBayes```** (Ronquist et al. 2012)
- **```ExaBayes```** (Aberer et al. 2014)
- **```RAxML```** (Stamatakis 2014)
- **```∂a∂i```** (Gutenkunst et al. 2009)
- **```fastSTRUCTURE```** (Raj et al. 2014)
- **```PhyloMapper```** (Lemmon and Lemmon 2008)

The current code in ```PIrANHA``` has been written largely with a focus on 1) analyses of DNA sequence data and SNPs or SNP loci generated from massively parallel sequencing runs on ddRAD-seq genomic libraries (e.g. Peterson et al. 2012), and 2) automating running these software programs on the user's personal machine (e.g. [MAGNET](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA/tree/master/MAGNET-0.1.9) pipeline and [pyRAD2PartitionFinder](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA/tree/master/pyRAD2PartitionFinder) scripts) or a remote supercomputer machine, and then conducting post-processing of the results. In particular, a number of scripts have been written with sections allowing them to be run (or cause other software to be called) on a supercomputing cluster, using code suitable for [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com) or [TORQUE](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/) (PBS; [Portable Batch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System)) resource management systems (in some cases, this functionality is noted by adding "Super" in the script filename, as in ```Super-pyRAD2PartitionFinder.sh```). 

### Distribution Structure and Pipelines

**What's new in this release?** 

Some of the changes included in the current official release are detailed below. However, refer to [changeLog.md](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA/blob/master/changeLog.md) for a full listing of updates to this repository since the last release (```PIrANHA``` v0.1.6.1).

## PIrANHA v0.1.7 (official minor version release) - February 19, 2019
- **February 19, 2019:** Improved ```phylipSubsampler.sh``` to check and account for differences in machine type. Now correctly accommodations UNIX (Mac) and LINUX systems.
- **February 2019:** Updated MAGNET script by adding a ```getBipartTrees``` function to the MAGNET pipeline, which organizes RAxML bipartitions trees for each locus (= best ML trees with bootstrap proportions along nodes the corresponding bootstrap searches search; resulting from ```-f a -x```options, which are included in all MAGNET calls to RAxML). Edited header and script banner to be prepped for future official release of MAGNET with versioning 0.1.9.
- **December 2018:** Added new MAGNET script updated to include --resume option, and to set raxml executable name one of two ways after detecting machine type (```raxml``` on Mac, ```raxmlHPC-SS3``` on Linux/supercomputer).
- **November 25, 2018:** Added to MAGNET/shell folder a new 'RAxMLRunChecker.sh' script v1.0, which counts the number of completed RAxML runs during the course of, or after, a MAGNET pipeline run, and also collates information on the dataset (e.g. number of patterns) and run (e.g. run time, optimum likelihood) for each locus/partition.
- **November 20, 2018 bug fix:** Updated MAGNET with edited 'MAGNET.sh' (now v0.1.7+) and 'NEXUS2gphocs.sh' (now v1.3+) scripts containing an important bug fix and some new code checking for whether the NEXUS to fasta file conversion succeeded.


*What is possible with PIrANHA?* *Who cares?*

**How PIrANHA scripts work together**

The goal of ```PIrANHA``` is to facilitate analysis pipelines that could be of interest to nearly anyone conducting evolutionary analyses of DNA sequence data using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. **Figure 1** and **Figure 2** below demonstrate flow and interactions of the current partition scheme, population structure, and phylogenetics pipelines with **software** and **"file types"** used to generate input for PIrANHA in the left column, and the way these are processed within/using ```PIrANHA``` illustrated in the right column. External software programs are shown in balloons with names in black italic font, while ```PIrANHA``` scripts are given in blue. Arrows show the flow of files through different pipelines, which terminate in results (shown right of final arrows at far right of each diagram).

## GETTING STARTED

### Dependencies

```PIrANHA```, and especially the ```MAGNET``` package ([here](https://github.com/justincbagley/MAGNET) or [here](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA/tree/master/MAGNET-0.1.9)) within ```PIrANHA```, relies on several software dependencies. These dependencies are described in some detail in README files for different scripts or packages; however, I provide a full list of them below, with asterisk marks preceding those already included in the "MAGNET-0.1.9" subdirectory of the current release. Of course, you can usually get away with not installing dependencies or software that are unrelated to the analysis you are conducting with ```PIrANHA```, but it is recommended that you install all dependencies to take full advantage of PIrANHA's capabilities, or be prepared for any analysis!

- ```PartitionFinder```
- ```BEAST``` v1.8.3++ and v2.4.2++ (or newer; available at: http://beast.community and http://beast2.org, respectively)
	* Updated ```Java```, appropriate Java virtual machine / jdk required
	* ```BEAGLE``` in beagle-lib (```libhmsbeagle```\* files) required
	* default ```BEAST``` packages required
	* ```SNAPP``` package addon required
- ```MrBayes``` v3.2++ (available at: http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/download.php)
- ```ExaBayes``` (available at: http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/exabayes/)
- ```RAxML``` (available at: http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/index.html)
- ```Perl``` (available at: https://www.perl.org/get.html).
- \*Nayoki Takebayashi's file conversion Perl scripts (available at: http://raven.iab.alaska.edu/~ntakebay/teaching/programming/perl-scripts/perl-scripts.html; note: some, but not all of these, come packaged within MAGNET)
- ```Python``` v2.7 and/or 3++ (available at: https://www.python.org/downloads/)
	* ```Numpy``` (available at: http://www.numpy.org/)
	* ```Scipy``` (available at: http://www.scipy.org/)
	* ```Cython``` (available at: http://cython.org/)
	* GNU Scientific Library (available at: http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
	* ```bioscripts.convert``` v0.4 ```Python``` package (available at: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bioscripts.convert/0.4; also see README for ```'NEXUS2gphocs.sh'```)

- ```∂a∂i``` v1.7.0++ (or v1.6.3; available at: https://bitbucket.org/gutenkunstlab/dadi/overview)
- ```R``` v3++ (available at: https://cran.r-project.org/)

Users must install all software not included in ```PIrANHA```, and ensure that it is available via the command line on their supercomputer and/or local machine (best practice is to simply install all software in both places). For more details, see the ```MAGNET``` README.

### Installation

:computer: As ```PIrANHA``` is primarily composed of UNIX shell scripts and customized R scripts, it is well suited for running on a variety of types of machines, especially UNIX/LINUX-like systems that are now commonplace in personal computing and dedicated supercomputer cluster facilities. The UNIX shell is common to all Linux systems and mac OS X. Using ```PIrANHA``` is thus very straightforward, because these systems come with the shell preinstalled. To install ```PIrANHA```, simply clone this repository and modify permissions, as follows:

```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA.git
$ cd ./PIrANHA/
$ chmod u+x ./*.sh; chmod u+x ./*/*.sh; chmod u+x ./*/*.pl
```
After doing this, ```PIrANHA``` should run "out-of-the-box" from most any folder on your machine. :thumbsup:


### IMPORTANT! - Passwordless SSH Access

```PIrANHA``` largely focuses on allowing users with access to a remote supercomputing cluster to take advantage of that resource in an automated fashion. Thus, it is implicitly assumed in most scripts and documentation that the user has set up passowordless ssh access to a supercomputer account. 

:hand: If you have not done this, or are unsure about this, then you should set up passwordless acces by creating and organizing appropriate and secure public and private ssh keys on your machine and the remote supercomputer prior to using PIrANHA. By "secure," I mean that, during this process, you should have closed write privledges to authorized keys by typing "chmod u-w authorized keys" after setting things up using ssh-keygen. 

:exclamation: Setting up passwordless SSH access is **VERY IMPORTANT** as ```PIrANHA``` scripts and pipelines will not work without setting this up first. The following links provide a list of useful tutorials/discussions that can help users set up passwordless SSH access:

- https://www.msi.umn.edu/support/faq/how-do-i-setup-ssh-keys
- https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/make-passwordless-ssh-connection-osx-10-9-mavericks-linux/ 
- https://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/

### Input and Output File Formats

:page_facing_up: ```PIrANHA``` scripts accept a number of different input file types, which are listed in Table 1 below. These can be generated by hand or are output by specific upstream software programs. As far as *output file types* go, ```PIrANHA``` outputs various text, PDF, and other kinds of graphical output from software that are linked through ```PIrANHA``` pipelines.

### :construction: _NOTE: The following 'Getting Started' content is Under Construction! E-mail me about it, or check back soon for updates!_ :construction:
### Phylogenetic Partitioning Scheme/Model Selection
#### _pyRAD2PartitionFinder_
Shell script for going directly from ```PHYLIP``` alignment (.phy) and partitions (.partisions) files output by ```pyRAD``` (Eaton 2014) or ```ipyrad``` (Eaton and Overcast 2016; for de novo assembly of reduced-representation sequence data from an NGS experiment) to inference of the optimal partitioning scheme and models of DNA sequence evolution for ```pyRAD```-defined SNP loci in PartitionFinder (Lanfear et al. 2012, 2016). See current release of ```pyRAD2PartitionFinder``` [scripts](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA/tree/master/pyRAD2PartitionFinder) for more information (e.g. detailed comments located within the code itself; a README is coming soon).

### Estimating Gene Trees for Species Tree Inference
#### _MAGNET (MAny GeNE Trees)_
Interactive shell pipeline for inferring maximum-likelihood gene trees in ```RAxML``` (Stamatakis 2014) for multilocus DNA sequence alignments (e.g. RAD loci from ddRAD-seq experiments, candidate genes, genomic contigs) to aid downstream  summary-statistics species tree inference. Please see the [README](https://github.com/justincbagley/MAGNET) for the ```MAGNET``` Package, which is available as its own stand-alone repository so that it can be tracked and continually given its own updated doi and citation by Zenodo. Three starting input file formats are currently supported, including single NEXUS (.nex), single ```G-PhoCS``` (.gphocs; formatted for ```G-PhoCS``` software, Gronau et al. 2011), and multiple ```PHYLIP``` files.

### Automating Bayesian evolutionary analyses in BEAST
#### _BEASTRunner_
[BEASTRunner](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA/blob/master/BEASTRunner/BEASTRunner.sh) automates conducting multiple runs of ```BEAST``` v1 or v2 (Drummond et al. 2012; Bouckaert et al. 2014) XML input files on a remote supercomputing cluster that uses SLURM resource management with PBS wrappers, or a TORQUE/PBS resource management system. See the ```BEASTRunner``` [README](https://github.com/justincbagley/PIrANHA/blob/master/BEASTRunner/README.md) for more information.

#### _BEAST_PathSampling_
The BEAST\_PathSampling directory is a new area of development within PIrANHA in which I am actively coding scripts to (1) edit ```BEAST``` v2++ XML files for path sampling analyses (Xie et al. 2011; Baele et al. 2012) and (2) automate moving/running the new path sampling XML files on a supercomputing cluster. Even as of August 2017, this is*very new stuff that is experimental and may still not be working*, so stay tuned for more updates soon.
